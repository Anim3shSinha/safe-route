## 💪 Motivation/Inspiration

Women's safety is a growing global concern, with incidents of abuse and assault affecting women in various aspects of their daily lives. Delhi, in particular, has a high crime rate, with a 41% share of the total crimes committed in the country. From rape and abduction to murders, Delhi is facing challenges that are transforming its status from the political capital of India to the crime capital.

In response to this critical issue, we introduce our web app, Safe Route. The goal of Safe Route is to provide women with a sense of security, allowing them to explore different aspects of life while staying connected to their safety network.

## 🚀 Features

- **Safety Routes:** Our app utilizes previous crime statistics against women in Delhi to develop safety routes. These routes are calculated based on a 'danger index,' providing users with the safest path to their destination.

- **Fastest Routes:** Our app not only prioritizes safety but also efficiency. It provides users with the fastest routes to their destination. The routing algorithm takes into account real-time traffic conditions and historical data, ensuring that users can reach their destination quickly and safely.

- **Distance and Time Duration:** Our app provides real-time information on the distance and time duration for walking, driving, and transit options. This feature is powered by the Google Maps API, offering users multiple transportation options to reach their destination safely.
